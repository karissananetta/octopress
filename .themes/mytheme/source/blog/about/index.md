I'm an undergraduate at Yale University (SM ’16) majoring in Philosophy and Computer Science. My main interests in philosophy currently include ethics, free will, the metaphysics of consciousness, and the question of the "good" life. I am a jazz musician who gigs around campus with a jazz quartet. I spend my spare time learning programming and web development.

When I’m not locked up in my room doing school work or wasting inordinate amounts of time on Reddit, I like going for walks in parks and woods; the more trees and the less noise the better. Dark coffees and good books keep me company at the local coffee shop on lazy Sunday afternoons.

Among my many ambitions, I wish I could write like David Foster Wallace, think like a Philosopher, play the piano like Bill Evans, the guitar like Joe Pass, and cook authentic Sichuan cuisine.
