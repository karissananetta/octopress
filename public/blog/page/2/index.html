  <div class="entry-content"><h1></h1>

<p>During this past week following Wellesley High School’s Graduation, various commentaries regarding Mr. McCullough’s speech have been posted all over the internet. It even hit the front page of <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/urz30/youre_not_special_graduation_speech_honest_and/">Reddit</a>. In this day and age, 1700 upvotes and counting on Reddit means that the post might as well be on the front page of the newspaper. But it annoys me that much of the commentary is negative. Although most of these negative reviews seem to surface from the lower echelons of the internet (e.g., “Boston.barstool.sports.com” where one poster said, “But if you don’t think this dude is one more school year away from going postal and shooting up this school, you are outside of your mind”), I think it’s a shame that even a speech presented in such an accessible form through carefully chosen, non-academic words could send contrary messages. It’s clear that McCullough wrote this speech to an audience of all sorts, not only the young intellectual graduates and the parents of a wealthy suburb. He wrote this speech to convey an important and universal message for everybody struggling to find that elusive balance between what one <em>needs</em> to do and what one <em>wants</em> to do in life.</p>

<p>It is the tension that springs from this very conflict that causes so much controversy around his speech. One commenter on Reddit stated, “It’s a good attitude to carry if you want some stability in your career and maybe rise to some middle management position, but not such a reasonable mindset if you have any real ambition in life…at it’s core it’s a cynical exhortation for the graduates to keep their heads down and just do what they’re told.” Some of you might chuckle at the irony; this is the exact <em>opposite</em> of what McCullough intended to convey. The commenter’s mistake lies in his conception of “ambition.” Immediately he establishes “stability in your career” and job position as the stakes of the argument. Moreover he suggests a connection between the position of one’s job and his degree of independence. This statement represents what I think is an increasingly problematic and outdated perspective on success and the proper way to live one’s life.</p>

<p>Having recently gone through the college application process, I’ve had to think about my major, graduate school, my future career, etc. Parallel to these, I’ve had to think about the value of brand name schools, the importance of salaries, and practical majors versus impractical. In other words, I’ve had to think about the meaning and importance of prestige – markers of reputation that can distinguish you on a paper resume. For truly, what other connotations can that word imply? In a nutshell, I hated how the college process reduced my character down into 500 word essays, lists of extracurricular activities, grades, and SAT scores. I kept wondering how colleges could ever make informed decisions about who to accept if the information they were using was so lacking, so single-dimensional, so seemingly ineffective at accomplishing colleges’ goals of creating diverse and thoughtful communities.</p>

<p>This way of assessing high schoolers has resulted in a robotic, artificially structured approach to school. We all know more than a few students who attempt to engineer their application to perfection. Their summers are spent doing hundreds of hours of community service not as an opportunity to help others but as a way to list off another achievement. Their academic career is not spent enjoying the profound personal value of learning, but wasted trying to average a number as close to 5.0 as possible. Though this is most prevalent in high school, I see it perpetuated by parents more and more in younger kids. My friend tutors a 7th grader whose parents have already brought her and her younger sibling to tour Harvard. When told that this tutor was attending Yale next year, she excitedly exclaims “Oh! That’s an Ivy!” This is not what education should be, especially during some of the most impressionable and developmental years of youth.</p>

<p>This problematic mentality is exactly what McCullough warns us against when he recites, “You’re not special.” He uses the word “special” to indicate a false sense of worth founded more on prestige than on meaningful achievement. He states:</p>

<blockquote><p>“…we have of late, we Americans, to our detriment, come to love accolades more than genuine achievement.  We have come to see them as the point – and we’re happy to compromise standards, or ignore reality, if we suspect that’s the quickest way, or only way, to have something to put on the mantelpiece, something to pose with, crow about, something with which to leverage ourselves into a better spot on the social totem pole.”</p>

<p> </p></blockquote>

<p>How can he be more clear than that? We “love accolades more than genuine achievement.” He is by no means trying to diminish the standards or weaken the ambition of us graduating seniors. Instead he urges us to strive for something much greater than what we are used to striving for in high school, to struggle for things without the hope of being recognized, to raise our standards above the objective and bravely enter the realm where all goals must be subjectively determined.</p>

<p>No, he is not being unrealistic. He is not advocating a world completely devoid of the need for grades and rankings and job positions. What McCullough puts forth is a vision of a <em>personal</em> paradigm, a way for the individual to see the world. The fact that GPA’s will always exist does not prevent me from realizing that a GPA speaks little about my passionate desire to learn. The fact that six digit salaries will always be competed for does not mean that they are my ultimate ambition. The balance between <em>need</em> and <em>want</em> can only be achieved if one’s true hopes and dreams are kept alive.</p>

<p>I think Mr. McCullough’s message is one that needs to be heard all over America. Students and parents from all walks of life need to hear his message: “Climb the mountain not to plant your flag, but to embrace the challenge, enjoy the air and behold the view.  Climb it so you can see the world, not so the world can see you,” because put simply, the real possibilities of life exceed infinitely beyond objective standards. As a matter of principle, living a fulfilling life demands the pursuit of true meaning and happiness as it pertains to the individual.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1></h1>

<p>*After a compelling and rather stern speech by our principal Dr. Keough about the importance of integrity and honesty during my graduation exercises at Wellesley High School, Mr. McCullough, an English teacher, gave a speech that had the audience roaring with laughter and nodding with understanding. His speech lifted our spirits and gave me something to ponder this summer. As I think about my future in all its glorious and frightening uncertainty, Mr. McCullough’s words remind me of what is most important, that “the great and curious truth of the human experience is that selflessness is the best thing you can do for yourself.” He refers to selflessness in the altruistic sense but also to convey the idea that the individual should not treat himself as an end, but rather, as a source. Using the mountain climber analogy, one should “Climb it so you can see the world, not so the world can see you.” This message resonated the strongest with me, the idea that life is lived best through relentless and active “pursuit,” of what is meaningful and applying one’s identity as the ultimate judge of what is worth living for and what isn’t.
Update: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=_lfxYhtf8o4">Here</a> is the speech on Youtube.</p>

<p>___|\<em>__|\</em>__|\<em>__|\</em>__|\<em>__|\</em>__|\<em>__|\</em>__|\<em>__|\</em>__|\<em>__|\</em>__|\<em>__|\</em>__|\<em>__|\</em>__|\<em>__|\</em>__|</p>

<p><em>“</em>Dr. Wong, Dr. Keough, Mrs. Novogroski, Ms. Curran, members of the board of education, family and friends of the graduates, ladies and gentlemen of the Wellesley High School class of 2012, for the privilege of speaking to you this afternoon, I am honored and grateful.  Thank you.</p>

<p>So here we are… commencement… life’s great forward-looking ceremony.  (And don’t say, “What about weddings?”  Weddings are one-sided and insufficiently effective.  Weddings are bride-centric pageantry.  Other than conceding to a list of unreasonable demands, the groom just stands there.  No stately, hey-everybody-look-at-me procession.  No being given away.  No identity-changing pronouncement.  And can you imagine a television show dedicated to watching guys try on tuxedos?  Their fathers sitting there misty-eyed with joy and disbelief, their brothers lurking in the corner muttering with envy.  Left to men, weddings would be, after limits-testing procrastination, spontaneous, almost inadvertent… during halftime… on the way to the refrigerator.  And then there’s the frequency of failure: statistics tell us half of you will get divorced.  A winning percentage like that’ll get you last place in the American League East.  The Baltimore Orioles do better than weddings.)</p>

<p>But this ceremony… commencement… a commencement works every time.  From this day forward… truly… in sickness and in health, through financial fiascos, through midlife crises and passably attractive sales reps at trade shows in Cincinnati, through diminishing tolerance for annoyingness, through every difference, irreconcilable and otherwise, you will stay forever graduated from high school, you and your diploma as one, ’til death do you part.</p>

<p>No, commencement is life’s great ceremonial beginning, with its own attendant and highly appropriate symbolism.  Fitting, for example, for this auspicious rite of passage, is where we find ourselves this afternoon, the venue.  Normally, I avoid clichés like the plague, wouldn’t touch them with a ten-foot pole, but here we are on a literal level playing field.  That matters.  That says something.  And your ceremonial costume… shapeless, uniform, one-size-fits-all.  Whether male or female, tall or short, scholar or slacker, spray-tanned prom queen or intergalactic X-Box assassin, each of you is dressed, you’ll notice, exactly the same.  And your diploma… but for your name, exactly the same.</p>

<p>All of this is as it should be, because none of you is special.</p>

<p>You are not special.  You are not exceptional.</p>

<p>Contrary to what your u9 soccer trophy suggests, your glowing seventh grade report card, despite every assurance of a certain corpulent purple dinosaur, that nice Mister Rogers and your batty Aunt Sylvia, no matter how often your maternal caped crusader has swooped in to save you… you’re nothing special.</p>

<p>Yes, you’ve been pampered, cosseted, doted upon, helmeted, bubble-wrapped.  Yes, capable adults with other things to do have held you, kissed you, fed you, wiped your mouth, wiped your bottom, trained you, taught you, tutored you, coached you, listened to you, counseled you, encouraged you, consoled you and encouraged you again.  You’ve been nudged, cajoled, wheedled and implored.  You’ve been feted and fawned over and called sweetie pie.  Yes, you have.  And, certainly, we’ve been to your games, your plays, your recitals, your science fairs.  Absolutely, smiles ignite when you walk into a room, and hundreds gasp with delight at your every tweet.  Why, maybe you’ve even had your picture in the Townsman!  [Editor&#8217;s upgrade: Or The Swellesley Report!] And now you’ve conquered high school… and, indisputably, here we all have gathered for you, the pride and joy of this fine community, the first to emerge from that magnificent new building…</p>

<p>But do not get the idea you’re anything special.  Because you’re not.</p>

<p>The empirical evidence is everywhere, numbers even an English teacher can’t ignore.  Newton, Natick, Nee… I am allowed to say Needham, yes? …that has to be two thousand high school graduates right there, give or take, and that’s just the neighborhood Ns.  Across the country no fewer than 3.2 million seniors are graduating about now from more than 37,000 high schools.  That’s 37,000 valedictorians… 37,000 class presidents… 92,000 harmonizing altos… 340,000 swaggering jocks… 2,185,967 pairs of Uggs.  But why limit ourselves to high school?  After all, you’re leaving it.  So think about this: even if you’re one in a million, on a planet of 6.8 billion that means there are nearly 7,000 people just like you.  Imagine standing somewhere over there on Washington Street on Marathon Monday and watching sixty-eight hundred yous go running by.  And consider for a moment the bigger picture: your planet, I’ll remind you, is not the center of its solar system, your solar system is not the center of its galaxy, your galaxy is not the center of the universe.  In fact, astrophysicists assure us the universe has no center; therefore, you cannot be it.  Neither can Donald Trump… which someone should tell him… although that hair is quite a phenomenon.</p>

<p>“But, Dave,” you cry, “Walt Whitman tells me I’m my own version of perfection!  Epictetus tells me I have the spark of Zeus!”  And I don’t disagree.  So that makes 6.8 billion examples of perfection, 6.8 billion sparks of Zeus.  You see, if everyone is special, then no one is.  If everyone gets a trophy, trophies become meaningless.  In our unspoken but not so subtle Darwinian competition with one another-which springs, I think, from our fear of our own insignificance, a subset of our dread of mortality – we have of late, we Americans, to our detriment, come to love accolades more than genuine achievement.  We have come to see them as the point – and we’re happy to compromise standards, or ignore reality, if we suspect that’s the quickest way, or only way, to have something to put on the mantelpiece, something to pose with, crow about, something with which to leverage ourselves into a better spot on the social totem pole.  No longer is it how you play the game, no longer is it even whether you win or lose, or learn or grow, or enjoy yourself doing it…  Now it’s “So what does this get me?”  As a consequence, we cheapen worthy endeavors, and building a Guatemalan medical clinic becomes more about the application to Bowdoin than the well-being of Guatemalans.  It’s an epidemic – and in its way, not even dear old Wellesley High is immune… one of the best of the 37,000 nationwide, Wellesley High School… where good is no longer good enough, where a B is the new C, and the midlevel curriculum is called Advanced College Placement.  And I hope you caught me when I said “one of the best.”  I said “one of the best” so we can feel better about ourselves, so we can bask in a little easy distinction, however vague and unverifiable, and count ourselves among the elite, whoever they might be, and enjoy a perceived leg up on the perceived competition.  But the phrase defies logic.  By definition there can be only one best.  You’re it or you’re not.</p>

<p>If you’ve learned anything in your years here I hope it’s that education should be for, rather than material advantage, the exhilaration of learning.  You’ve learned, too, I hope, as Sophocles assured us, that wisdom is the chief element of happiness.  (Second is ice cream…  just an fyi)  I also hope you’ve learned enough to recognize how little you know… how little you know now… at the moment… for today is just the beginning.  It’s where you go from here that matters.</p>

<p>As you commence, then, and before you scatter to the winds, I urge you to do whatever you do for no reason other than you love it and believe in its importance.  Don’t bother with work you don’t believe in any more than you would a spouse you’re not crazy about, lest you too find yourself on the wrong side of a Baltimore Orioles comparison.  Resist the easy comforts of complacency, the specious glitter of materialism, the narcotic paralysis of self-satisfaction.  Be worthy of your advantages.  And read… read all the time… read as a matter of principle, as a matter of self-respect.  Read as a nourishing staple of life.  Develop and protect a moral sensibility and demonstrate the character to apply it.  Dream big.  Work hard.  Think for yourself.  Love everything you love, everyone you love, with all your might.  And do so, please, with a sense of urgency, for every tick of the clock subtracts from fewer and fewer; and as surely as there are commencements there are cessations, and you’ll be in no condition to enjoy the ceremony attendant to that eventuality no matter how delightful the afternoon.</p>

<p>The fulfilling life, the distinctive life, the relevant life, is an achievement, not something that will fall into your lap because you’re a nice person or mommy ordered it from the caterer.  You’ll note the founding fathers took pains to secure your inalienable right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness-quite an active verb, “pursuit”-which leaves, I should think, little time for lying around watching parrots rollerskate on Youtube.  The first President Roosevelt, the old rough rider, advocated the strenuous life.  Mr. Thoreau wanted to drive life into a corner, to live deep and suck out all the marrow.  The poet Mary Oliver tells us to row, row into the swirl and roil.  Locally, someone… I forget who… from time to time encourages young scholars to carpe the heck out of the diem.  The point is the same: get busy, have at it.  Don’t wait for inspiration or passion to find you.  Get up, get out, explore, find it yourself, and grab hold with both hands.  (Now, before you dash off and get your YOLO tattoo, let me point out the illogic of that trendy little expression-because you can and should live not merely once, but every day of your life.  Rather than You Only Live Once, it should be You Live Only Once… but because YLOO doesn’t have the same ring, we shrug and decide it doesn’t matter.)</p>

<p>None of this day-seizing, though, this YLOOing, should be interpreted as license for self-indulgence.  Like accolades ought to be, the fulfilled life is a consequence, a gratifying byproduct.  It’s what happens when you’re thinking about more important things.  Climb the mountain not to plant your flag, but to embrace the challenge, enjoy the air and behold the view.  Climb it so you can see the world, not so the world can see you.  Go to Paris to be in Paris, not to cross it off your list and congratulate yourself for being worldly.  Exercise free will and creative, independent thought not for the satisfactions they will bring you, but for the good they will do others, the rest of the 6.8 billion-and those who will follow them.  And then you too will discover the great and curious truth of the human experience is that selflessness is the best thing you can do for yourself.  The sweetest joys of life, then, come only with the recognition that you’re not special.</p>

<p>Because everyone is.</p>

<p>Congratulations.  Good luck.  Make for yourselves, please, for your sake and for ours, extraordinary lives.”</p>

<p>**- David McCullough, June 1st 2012</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1></h1>

<p>I wish I could say that I had a sudden realization, some profound epiphany concerning the human condition. It would be more thrilling for the reader. Unfortunately, the insights that I have reached through philosophy usually come about through a much more gradual, much less dramatic process. In compelling me to alter my understanding and interpretation of the world, the process can be dauntingly uncertain and even painful. I consider this very process of critical thought “philosophy.” But before I continue, I must clarify the meaning of this word. By philosophy, I mean the process of thinking, perceiving, and judging oneself and the world rationally in accordance with empirical knowledge. Philosophy also refers to the study of general and fundamental problems concerning truth, ethics, and human existence. I will address both in this essay. Nowadays people tend to have a negative conception of philosophy. The word invokes images of grand ivory towers situated behind ivy walls. Inside the towers in an oak-paneled room a pretentious old man sits on a gilded armchair, living in luxurious decadence. Out of touch with real world issues and having never encountered adversity, he spends his time contemplating ideas to amuse his intellect. This is not philosophy. In my experience, even educated people frequently misconceive of philosophy as an esoterically useless discipline meant only for an intelligentsia out of touch with the world. Among university students for instance, philosophy is one of the most ridiculed majors, right next to art history and English literature. This attitude towards philosophy has always infuriated me, not only because it shows the underlying ignorance of the believer, but also because of its glaring irony. The course of my life thus far has led me to firmly believe that philosophy is the most practical and necessary of all human disciplines.</p>

<p>I did not always believe in philosophy. In fact, I did not even know what philosophy was until sometime during my sophomore year of high school. Rather than being introduced to it or stumbling upon it by chance, I was eventually led to philosophy by my intellectual curiosity. In every class, as soon as I questioned the material on a deep enough level, the same type of apparently unanswerable questions would keep recurring. Biology class defined life as a series of ongoing chemical reactions and suggested that consciousness is the mere exchange of sodium and potassium ions across gated protein channels in the brain. In questioning these definitions, I hit upon philosophical discussions of defining human life, the existence the Platonic soul, and the existence of free will. In English class, reading Hamlet compelled me to consider the ethics of suicide and the possibility of living a meaningful existence despite life’s inevitable tragedies. Even math class, during our study of the summation of infinite series, caused me to contemplate the idea of infinity and the limits of the human mind in conceptualizing the infinite. These are but a few examples in the myriad questions I struggled with during high school.</p>

<p>As I began to systematically contemplate each of these questions, I noticed how they converged and oftentimes complemented one another. The debate about the existence of a soul coincides directly with the god debate. The discussion about free will relates to the ethics of suicide. Thus, not only does philosophy underlie the various academic subjects, but it ties everything together. It acts as a sort of interdisciplinary network, allowing me to synthesize information from one area with that of another. This synthesis allows me to produce conclusions, useful facts which I use to make decisions. In real life, decisions rarely require only a single area of knowledge. All human decisions necessitate thinking about various issues that branch into science, humanities, and other areas of thought. So in a sense, philosophy better prepares me to make real life decisions by making sense of knowledge in the context of all other types of knowledge. It is self-evident that no knowledge has any useful application unless it is contextualized with knowledge from other areas.</p>

<p>I have just discussed the importance of philosophy in the academic realm, but philosophy also exists as a powerful way of thinking. The German philosopher Nietzsche states, “There are no facts, only interpretations.” Apart from the debate of the possibility of absolute truth, there exists the simple fact that interpretation is a necessary and integral part of human perception. One might ask, “What about the objective truths derived from math and science?” I am referring to perception with the intent of applying the information. Of course the fact “one plus one equals two” leaves no room for interpretation. But to make use of it one must interpret this fact in the context of a real life situation. For instance, does falling in love and marrying somebody mean that the two of you exist as a single entity? Or do you both exist separately? What degree of agency should each retain in such a relationship? These questions depend on the understanding that quantities change when combined, but the meaning of such a fact must still be interpreted. In other words, although there are definite facts about the physical nature of the world, these are not truths in the strictly human sense. Knowing one plus one equals two does not inform us on how we should think about ourselves and the world. Hard facts must be interpreted, or humanized, in such a way that allows them to be applied to our lives. It is through this very process of human interpretation that we construct our reality. Philosophy refines the way one interprets the information he receives. The philosophical approach to interpretation entails constantly thinking about external information and cross-referencing it with other facts, with the ultimate goal of reaching a useful and informed conclusion. By approaching the world with a severely critical eye that questions every iota of information it receives, one can reach the most objective conception of the given situation. This involves understanding the various internal biases of both the information giver and receiver. As discussed above, humans operate based on interpretation, not hard fact. No matter how hard they try to give an objective account, it is necessarily influenced by subjective interpretation. Furthermore, one’s own reception of information is unavoidably skewed by internal biases. People often bend things to hear what they want. Philosophy works to counter this two sided subjectivity, allowing one to reach the most objective reality. I had to steel myself with this mentality during the college search process.</p>

<p>Every year during the summer and fall, colleges unleash impressively aggravating advertising campaigns involving tons of paper, emails, and phone calls. In its wake lie acres of deforestation, overflowing spam folders, and millions of poor misled students. Colleges like to personally address the letters to students by first name, writing in a friendly tone hoping to draw them in. They use numbers to boast about the number of Nobel prizes their faculty have received, their annual endowment, and the racial diversity of the student body. They present their institution as alone possessing these characteristics, existing as the most perfect place in the world for you to spend the next four years. I can imagine how the unsuspecting high school junior can easily get lassoed by this type of advertising. In order to find a truly well-fitting college, I approached the process fully aware of the marketing strategies these institutions employed. Furthermore, I understood that the colleges I was applying to are essentially similar with regards to academic quality, diversity of student body, and social atmosphere, differing only in location and other minor characteristics. This approach, I would imagine, spared me the stress of desperately wanting to be accepted to the only college I thought would suit me. I realized that I was applying to a number of colleges I would be very happy at, and that in the end, the experience will depend more on how I use the institution’s resources rather than what resources it provided me. By attaining the most objective reality of the situation, I was able to create the most beneficial interpretation.</p>

<p>Part of interpreting a fact includes determining how valuable that fact is. As humans, we live our lives doing, or with the hope of doing, what we want. We only want what matters to us, what is meaningful and what is valuable. Philosophy aids me on this quest for existential meaning because what I care about is often not easily apparent. It requires a combination of life experiences and deep contemplation to realize what I truly care about. I’m not talking about simple pleasures which can be discovered through reflexive emotional responses. Watching an entertaining movie makes me happy, but the happiness is also shallow and temporary. Simple thrills do not motivate me in the long run. What makes life worth living is the promise of experiencing true, lasting meaning. For instance, it took me many years to fully appreciate my musical education. I always hated practicing and listening to jazz and classical music when I was younger. Now, listening and playing such music gives me a feeling of satisfaction that I don’t get from anything else. Although this may have been a result of my acclimation to music after studying it for so many years, I think the full explanation must acknowledge the fact that I tried to understand and relate to the meaning behind the music. After eight years of study, I know with certainty that I value jazz and classical music on the deepest level.</p>

<p>Having a philosophical state of mind means constantly questioning not only the accuracy of one’s perceptions but also the quality of one’s valuations. It is easy to convince yourself that you enjoy something you actually don’t. Although I have no experience with this, my older brother David shared his experience in the job market and the realizations he’s come to. He told me about how fresh college graduates are frequently misled by jobs with high salaries, not considering the value of the work itself. After graduating, my brother was offered jobs by banks and consulting firms with impressive salaries, but these were jobs that didn’t interest him. Instead he chose to explore the tech-startup industry, working for smaller groups with more modest salaries and lacking the financial benefits of large corporations. Because of this, he’s discovered a passion for computer programming and web development, something he never would’ve been exposed to had he decided to work for a bank. I’m sure that many adults find themselves in the doldrums of a job they hate, realizing after many miserable years that the salary does not outweigh the negatives of the work itself. This can be avoided if one always knows and prioritizes what he deeply values. Through this rationalization, one can easily conclude that money should be treated as a means, not as an end. Philosophy can help one realize that it is not money that is valuable, but rather the possibilities that money provides. By constantly reevaluating my values, I emerge with a more absolute and profound awareness of what is meaningful to me. Philosophy acts as an intellectual sieve, filtering out the refuse and ensuring that what remains is truly valuable to oneself.</p>

<p>I’ve offered my thoughts on the academic importance of philosophy as well as its personal importance in attaining the most objective conception of the world and in striving for true meaning. But the question still remains, what is philosophy? Defining it is difficult because it exists in so many different forms and contexts. In the broadest sense, I consider philosophy an intellectual process which uses reason to investigate and interpret the nature of oneself, one’s environment, and the relationship of the two. Furthermore, philosophy is an internal mode of thinking that is reliable under all external circumstances. In its most ideal form, philosophy should exist as a universal approach to human problems, from the mundane to the profound. Emphasis is placed on reason because only through systematic logic one can effectively determine consistency and inconsistency, and consequentially, right versus wrong and value versus lack of value. All of this philosophical thinking leads to the ultimate purpose of deciding how to live one’s life.</p>

<p>Only by first evaluating the world and oneself objectively can one then decide how to act, acting being the interface between the self and the environment. Only by first answering the question “What is?” can one answer “What should be?” Everyday life demands decisions from us of varying degrees, compelling us to ask ourselves what is moral and immoral. This dilemma presents itself to me every time I choose to illegally pirate music. On one hand, it’s against the law and could have very serious legal ramifications if caught. On the other hand, the artists of the music I pirate already passed away. Their estates would receive all of the commissions from purchases. Knowing them to be artists in the purest sense, I can comfortably conclude that they would rather want people to be exposed to their musical artistry and genius than for their estates to earn money. This is an example of how philosophy remains essential dealing with the question of “How should I act?” Philosophy rationally organizes one’s knowledge and principles to allow this question to be adequately addressed. Because I am constantly exposed to new situations and gaining new knowledge, my answers to this question constantly fluctuates. It is easy to stop considering new information, unintentionally reverting to an outdated ethical mode. As shown by history, the individual’s failure to update their opinions with new facts can lead to disastrous injustices. I remember feeling deeply disturbed when studying about events like the Holocaust, the Rape of Nanjing, and the My Lai Massacre. How could these things happen? How could human beings commit such terrible atrocities to one another, not only murdering and raping but also torturing and mutilating. What happened to the common sense and rational instinct that should have been screaming for an end? These are unanswered questions which will continue to haunt me. But part of the answer, I think, is the fact that the individuals relinquished their ability to independently reason and valuate. Hannah Arendt says, “The sad truth is that most evil is done by people who never make up their minds to be good or evil.” I agree with her idea of the “banality of evil,” that more often than not, human injustice is a result of a lack of thinking, and consequentially the lack of exercising good will. Evil does not arise from actively sinful perpetrators but rather from passively unthinking and prejudiced bystanders. The philosophical mindset both prevents the individual from succumbing to the prejudices of his own complacent intellect and that of others. The philosopher exists as an active agent promoting active thought and thus spreading active morality.</p>

<p>My life has led me to philosophy not out of choice, but out of necessity. My education and personal experiences demand that I answer questions which require a rigorous type of thinking satisfied only by philosophy. For me, the question that will always remain at the core of my life is “What makes life worth living?” More specifically, what makes my life worth living? All other philosophical questions lead to this one. Inquiries into the nature of the universe, one’s identity, and the proper ethics both depend on and help answer this singular question. It is one which is expressed in the art and literature of every era from every region of the world. Contemplation of this question remains at the core of the fundamental human experience. In this sense, there is a touching element of human tragedy to philosophy, that it paradoxically strives to answer a question that has no objectively definitive answer. There is something inexplicably beautiful and deeply inspiring about this Sisyphean struggle. As a philosopher, I’ve come to realize that one does not attain meaning by simply answering the question conclusively and putting the matter to rest. Rather, meaning is found in the very process of attempting to find an answer. What has made my life worth living are all of the things I’ve experienced during my philosophical quest, from the inspiring to the tragic, from the profound to the mundane, from the beautiful to the grotesque. What makes life worth living is the chance to be a philosopher – the opportunity to engage in this existential dialectic, to experience what it means to be human and to know what it means to be me.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1></h1>

<p>I first discovered Frank O’Hara while watching Mad Men. The last two stanzas of O’Hara’s poem “Mayakovsky” was recited by Don Draper in this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XKN0iZG_4s">expressive, melancholic scene.</a> What first struck me was O’Hara’s language; his verse seemed so alive with motion. A combination of a colloquial tone and elevated artistic discourse created a very satisfying effect for me, something I could at once understand and appreciate as profound. Furthermore, his syntax makes his words dance in a way that I haven’t encountered in other poems. His poems are light and easy to move through, as if affected by a certain smooth coherence.</p>

<p>That is ironic, because his poetry is anything but coherent. Living in the artistic milieu of mid-20th century Manhattan, O’Hara was very much inspired by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_expressionism">Abstract Expressionism.</a> He believed that art itself existed on a transcendent level. So rather than the artist commanding the art, he believed that art commanded the artist. This notion has roots in the Greek idea that inspiration occurs when a God “breathes upon” someone, that humans draw creativity from some higher external source. In this manner, O’Hara believed that all “accidents” in art were meant to be. He let his poems progress rather organically, writing about thoughts and feelings as they spontaneously arrived rather than crafting the poem around a premeditated central theme. Compared to poetry of the previous centuries, this approach is quite new. It is abstract, cerebral, and difficult to understand. But at the same time, his poetry is refreshing, innovative, and above all, beautiful. Here are some of my favorite poems by Frank O’Hara:</p>

<p><strong>POEM</strong></p>

<p>Instant coffee with slightly sour cream<br/>
in it, and a phone call to the beyond<br/>
which doesn’t seem to be coming any nearer.<br/>
“Ah daddy, I wanna stay drunk many days”<br/>
on the poetry of a new friend<br/>
my life held precariously in the seeing<br/>
hands of others, their and my impossibilities.<br/>
Is this love, now that the first love<br/>
has finally died, where there were no impossibilities?</p>

<p><strong>Wind</strong></p>

<p>Who’d have thought<br/>
that snow falls<br/>
it always circled whirling<br/>
like a thought<br/>
in the glass ball<br/>
around me and my bear</p>

<p>Then it seemed beautiful<br/>
containment<br/>
snow whirled<br/>
nothing ever fell<br/>
nor my little bear<br/>
bad thoughts<br/>
imprisoned in crystal</p>

<p>beauty has replaced itself with evil</p>

<p>And the snow whirls only<br/>
in fatal winds<br/>
briefly<br/>
then falls</p>

<p>it always loathed containment<br/>
beasts<br/>
I love evil</p>

<p>Frank O’Hara also wrote one of my favorite quotes: “Simply to live does not justify existence, for life is a mere gesture on the surface of the earth, and death a return to that from which we had never been wholly separated; but oh to leave a trace, no matter how faint, of that brief gesture! For someone, some day, may find it beautiful!”</p>

<p><em>This is a response to an argument which Hume presents in his “Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion.”</em></p>

<p>Hume bases his dialectic on the idea that knowledge must rest on <em>a posteriori</em> experience rather than faith. This is because empirical evidence is essential to determining the plausibility of one idea over another in defining truth. Without experience ideas “…would all be possible; but, being all equally possible, he would never…give a satisfactory account for his preferring one of them to the rest” (182). Using this system he carefully refutes an <em>a posteriori</em> pro-God argument offered by Cleanthes. Cleanthes argues the existence of God by first asserting the similarity of the universe to a machine, something produced by man’s reason. Then, with the assumption that similar effects implies similar causes, Cleanthes claims that the universe must have been designed by an entity similar to a human being, possessing a similar faculty of thinking. This being is God. Philo dismantles this argument chiefly by attacking the validity of Cleanthes analogy. Philo claims, “Every alteration of circumstances occasions a doubt concerning the event” (183). Because there exists so many differences and unaccounted variables between man’s machines and the entire universe, Cleanthes analogy is unsound. Therefore, God cannot be claimed to exist in this manner. Philo then adds the argument that man’s faculty of reasoning exists as merely “one of the springs of the universe, as well as heat or cold, attraction or repulsion” (184). He equates the cause of thought to all other causes. Therefore, it is unreasonable to project the cause of thought as the ultimate cause of the universe. In his typical fashion, Hume uses skepticism to refute the God argument. Finally, assuming that such a grand analogy could be made, Hume subtly places “generation,” the system of birth observed in animals, as a more probable cause than reason. This is because humans have observed that reason derives from generation, but generation has not been observed to derive from reason. Therefore, generation exists as an earlier cause, thus it is more likely to be the ultimate cause.</p>

<p>Hume’s structured and logically rigorous manner of argument impresses me. The logical progression from one statement to the other appears quite sound. However, I question Hume’s assumption that <em>means</em> adapt to <em>ends</em>. In both Cleanthes and Philo’s arguments, there was a tacit acceptance of this idea without addressing the possibility that <em>ends </em>merely stem from <em>means</em>. What humans observe as the product of design may very well exist as the logical effect of the random arrangement of the universe. What we assume to be means may merely be the product of random chance. For instance, the arrangement of our solar system may have been due to chance rather than some intended cause. Perhaps Hume did not mean to imply this. Nevertheless, he implies a certain directed, or even conscious, <em>intent</em> in his idea of cause. I wish Hume addressed this assumption and clarified the nature of his idea of “cause.” I also question Hume’s seemingly casual relegation of human thinking as one of hundreds of causes. He describes it as “so minute, so weak, so bounded a principle” and “this little agitation of the brain which we call ‘thought’” (184). As a philosopher I believe Hume should hold higher regard for his single most important ability. It seems that he has extended his ideal of skepticism too far. Nevertheless, I consider his dismissal of thought as an interesting idea which could potentially inspire certain other ideas. For this reason, I will continue contemplating it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1></h1>

<p>I wrote this partially in response to Lyle Zynda’s “The Nature of Reality and Why It Matters.”</p>

<p><em>Realism</em> is the idea that there exists an objective universe external to the human perception. Realist philosophers believe that the word “real” can refer to something independent of the human senses. What humans perceive may not necessarily constitute the definite, real world. According to one fundamental epistemological argument, humans do not experience reality directly. Rather, we merely perceive our brain’s interpretation of reality. This provides realists significant doubt that reality matches the subjective experience of humans. Furthermore, biologically the human body is only capable of receiving a limited range of sensory data. For instance, we cannot detect electromagnetic fields or perceive infrared radiation like other animals. Even though we don’t experience them directly, our science proves their existence. Therefore, it is possible that humans have a very limited grasp on the true reality.</p>

<p>This debate over the true nature of reality may seem like something whimsical and only for the amusement of dilettantes. Upon further reflection, how an individual decides to approach and answer this ultimately personal question holds enormous stake because it influences the way he conducts his life. Whereas the realist may decide to pursue a life of science in order to uncover what he believes to be an objective truth, a non-realist may decide to follow his instinct because reality is ultimately subjective. The question also deals with hope and imagination. Consider an individual who disagrees with the social norms of his time. If he was a realist, perhaps he would decide to live in contentedness because ultimately the world operates based on higher functions. The non-realist may be galvanized by his belief in the malleable nature of reality, that the status quo is not necessarily the way things have to exist.</p>

<p>Personally, I think this question matters in terms of choosing whether or not to believe in one’s current environment. I question Nozick’s claim that given proper thought, most people would not choose to enter an illusory state. Both Nozick and <em>The Matrix</em> strongly associate living in a dream with dishonor and corruption. I believe that because there is insufficient positive proof in the existence of an objective reality, humans are forced to trust their default, subjective experience. Accepting a subjective reality is not only more logical but preferable. Our senses render everything we experience and our consciousness processes and decides how we react. Humans are unable to step outside of our mind-body complex. Our whole lives are inescapably lived in a subjective manner, whether we believe in an objective reality or not.  Furthermore, what matters and what is meaningful exists as a human question. For all we know, the very concept of “meaning” is man-made. This definition necessitates subjectivity in the human quest for meaning. Therefore, logically I see no philosophical problem with choosing to enter a dream world that is more “perfect” (also a human, subjective concept) than the current world. Why would it matter to escape to a dream, if we weren’t ever aware of its artifice? How do we, as human beings, know for sure that we are not in a dream right now? This in conjunction with the assumption that human experience is subjective suggests the identical nature of the “real” world and the “dream world.” There exists no difference able to be grasped by the human.</p>

<p>In order for me to define what matters to me, I must first decide “What is reality?” For this reason, I will continue to ponder this question as I grow older.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1></h1>

<p>For my English class we had to read and respond to an <a href="http://www.carl-jung.net/collective_unconscious.html">interesting article</a>.</p>

<p>Coincidentally, this article formalizes a question I have been pondering for some time now. Is individuality merely an illusion for what is actually uniform throughout all humans? To what degree can humans vary in behavior and belief? Most importantly, do humans behave based on a system of innate formulas and biological patterns? This question holds immense stake because if our thoughts and actions <em>can</em> be defined as preconceived responses, then there is no such thing as free-will. If this is the case, we do not make decisions but rather carry out predetermined responses appropriate to the situation based on the stimuli we receive. But based on the reading, Jung does not extend his idea to such lengths as I have. He is unclear as to what extent the collective unconscious determines human behavior. Viewed like this, Jung’s idea becomes rather commonplace. It seems obvious that there would be similarities in parent-child relationships and the way humans respond to failure.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.google.com/url?source=imglanding&amp;ct=img&amp;q=http://www.metaphysics-for-life.com/images/humanmind.jpg&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=adRrTrDXDqje0QGZ3aHuBA&amp;ved=0CAYQ8wc&amp;usg=AFQjCNFU69xSgfka3KtnjOMQtIGoQb3dAg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Concerning the question I proposed at the beginning, I realize it may unfairly imply a one-sided answer. Human nature may be a combination of both Jung’s collective unconscious, which we have no control over, and individuality, which we do have control over to some extent. Then my question becomes, what is the relationship between the collective unconscious and free will? Is one dependent on the other? What has more influence over our lives?</p>

<p>Jung’s idea compels me to ask if the collective unconscious is stagnant or malleable. Does it exist as something eternal and unchanging? Or, as times progress and human society changes, does the collective unconscious change as well? Perhaps the collective unconscious remains fundamentally the same, but its manifestations change according to its environment. If this is the case, then the eastern tradition of discovering one’s Self will always remain pertinent.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1></h1>

<p>I’m sure many have encountered the idea that “Communism fails in practice because humans are inherently selfish.” I tend to get annoyed whenever somebody says this (especially if they declare it with an attitude of intellectualism, as if to show off the understanding of an incredibly advanced philosophical concept), for two reasons. First, the saying is cliche. Second, this concept is too easy; it’s an answer that blindly undermines the complexity of human nature. If I wanted to be pompous, I could say that believers of this idea lack a basic understanding of humanity. But, because this contradicts the spirit of the claim itself, I will refrain. In this post, I explore the second reason.</p>

<p>Put simply, I believe selfishness, or egotism, does indeed exist as an intrinsic characteristic of humans, but that there are thresholds, or degrees, of selfishness. Selfishness cannot be represented by any single parable, it does not appear as one color. Rather, it manifests itself in a multitude of ways that, according to its simple definition, may not be perceived as selfishness.</p>

<p>Consider the situation in which a group of high school students found an organization that raises money for a charity. The organization ends up raising a decent amount of money. However, the students’ primary motivation is not that of philanthropy, but to augment their college application. While the integrity and principle of their motives are controversial, the utility of the resulting action removes any doubt of its benefit. It is strange that human selfishness can manifest itself in beneficial actions, one of many seemingly impossible contradictions of ideals that humans are capable of.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.google.com/url?source=imgres&amp;ct=img&amp;q=http://www.corrupt.org/drupal/files/images/help.jpg&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=unAKTrrDDoLw0gGgpuR6&amp;ved=0CAQQ8wc4IQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNGVv2b2PlsZU4Z9XvsfsSz2ETh5PA" alt="" /></p>

<p>As previously mentioned, I think selfishness exists in degrees. The shallowest thresholds of egotism express themselves in the most corrupt ways, in situations able to be categorized as simply “bad.” For instance, murdering for money. On the other hand, the deepest thresholds of selfishness transcend superficially crass motives. Instead, such thresholds are selfishly motivated by metaphysical ideas of justice, love, and empathy. At the deepest levels, humans exhibit a selfishness for preserving their own morality. It is a self-indulgence in being “good,” for few can deny the unparalleled satisfaction from charitable actions. We tend to classify such behavior as “selfless,” but I think altruism is closely connected to the self. Would I be going too far in saying, “Altruism is merely a veiled selfishness?” Perhaps, with an expanded definition of selfishness, the idea is not too far-fetched.</p>

<p>But why understand these dialectics, besides the philosopher’s job of finding consistency to explain ostensibly irrational human behavior? The stake, as I see it, lies in reforming society. I believe the shallower tiers of selfishness can be eliminated through a combination of education and the insurance of survival necessities. There is no necessary provocation for an educated man, who has food, clothes, and shelter, to commit crimes. As the two bottom-most levels of</p>
